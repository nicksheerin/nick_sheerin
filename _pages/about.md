I'm currently focused on building software for wearable devices as an **Algorithm Development Engineer** for GameChanger Analytics. My interests are in mechatronics, wearable robotics, biomechanics, machine learning, and data science. I am curious and constantly learning about new topics and technology.

I received my **Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (Specialization: Mechatronics & Control)** from the Georgia Institute of Technology, as a member in the [Exoskeleton and Prosthetic Intelligent Controls (EPIC) Lab](https://www.epic.gatech.edu/). My doctoral studies focused on the development of intelligent controllers for powered robotic prostheses and exoskeletons for individuals with gait impairments. This was achieved by utilizing embedded sensor & microprocessor technology paired with machine learning and sensor fusion to improve robustness and intelligence of these devices in real time.
