I'm passionate about robotics and controls, with a knack for solving complex challenges with practical & innovative solutions. 
I prioritize a strong foundation in systems integration, product development, and data-driven problem solving. 
I received my **B.S. in Mechanical Engineering** from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. I have experience in aerospace, manufacturing, and atmospheric research. At Boeing, I contributed to the certification of safety-critical systems and developed a secure RFID-based baggage scanning prototype aimed at improving operational efficiency. I’ve also designed a boilerplate for a digital twin and manufacturing tools at Honeywell, supported hybrid learning environments in higher education, and conducted climate data analysis at NASA JPL. 

With hands-on expertise in SolidWorks, Python, and MATLAB, as well as being FE Certified, I bring both technical rigor and a mindset of continuous improvement to every project. Whether optimizing code for satellite data analysis or managing corrective actions across crossfunctional teams, I take pride in blending engineering precision with practical innovation.
