I currently work as a consultant for GameChanger Analytics, where I am working in the role of an **Algorithm Development Engineer**. My primary interests are in the field of mechatronics, wearable robotics, biomechanics,machine learning, and data science. I am curious and love to learn about new topics and technology.

I received my **Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (Specialization: Mechatronics & Control)** from Georgia Institute of Technology, as a member in the [Exoskeleton and Prosthetic Intelligent Controls (EPIC) Lab](https://www.epic.gatech.edu/). My doctoral studies focused on developing intelligent controllers for powered robotic prostheses and exoskeletons for individuals with gait impairments. I utilized embedded sensor & microprocessor technology paired with machine learning and sensor fusion to improve robustness and intelligence of these devices in real time. 

<!-- I also offer tutoring and consulting services — please contact me if you would like to discuss potential services, partnerships, or collaborations. -->

<q>**The mindset isn’t about seeking a result — it’s more about the process of getting to that result. It’s about the journey and the approach. It’s a way of life. I do think that it’s important, in all endeavors, to have that mentality!**</q> &#8211; Kobe Bryant
