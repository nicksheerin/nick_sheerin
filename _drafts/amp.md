This project explores the properties of a guitar amp. Inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/4wNtbUjQRUU) and [Blog Post](https://vintagemusictech.blogspot.com/2019/05/make-mini-amp-for-guitar-lm386-chip.html), the project aimed to refine established techniques to create a custom guitar amp into a more portable container in an effort to avoid exposed wires.

## Overall Summary

Few know the ferocity of a rabbit thirsting for wires. Meet Chunnu, destroyer of chargers, the rabbit who inspired this build.

## Takeaways
Working on this computer vision-based ML tutorial improved my understanding of the importance of a well-structured, modular pipeline. One key takeaway was realizing how critical preprocessing was: extracting video frames and preparing the data before model inference was essential for accurate object detection and tracking. By integrating a pre-trained inference model with complementary components—such as camera movement estimation, view transformation, and position interpolation—I discovered how raw images can be transformed into actionable insights, like measuring speed, distance, and ball possession.

Another valuable learning outcome was mastering the post-processing and integration steps needed to convert raw model outputs into meaningful athlete metrics. This process required not only applying the inference model but also coordinating multiple specialized modules—such as team assignment and ball control detection—to produce a comprehensive analysis. Overall, I learned how to design and implement a scalable ML pipeline, streamline iteration cycles for faster development, and generate clear, annotated output videos that effectively communicate complex analytics.
