This project was a collaborative effort between 22 students across four degree paths to compete in an Autonomous mining competition sponsored by NASA's Artemis Program and Caterpillar.

## Overall Summary

The Apollo missions provided universities the ability to aid in the program by developing new technology for spacecraft and equipment and research material brought back from the lunar surface. NASA initiated the Artemis Mission in December 2017 to return astronauts to the Moon, to establish a long-term presence on the Moon and to gain experience in the unhospitable environment of space in preparation for the eventual journey to Mars. In 2010, the Lunabotics competition was challenges Universities to develop a robot to autonomously mine the icy regolith beneath the Moon's surface. This icy regolith would then be processed to create water which doesn't require transport from Earth. 

The competition requires the robot to move from a random orientation in the starting arena to the excavation zone. Once in the excavation zone the robot was required to dig 30.5 cm through crushed limestone to excavate regolith simulant (gravel).

New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology was the first team invited to the competition in 2021. I participated in both the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 competitions.

## System Overview

The robot, named DAVIID (Directed Autonomous Vehicle forInterspatial Digging, with II indicating itssecond generation), was designed tofunction on various terrain and perform thedesignated tasks as determined by theLunabotics challenge criteria using NASA’sSystem Engineering process. Building uponthe insight gained by the development andperformance of the previous robot, DAVID,Miner 49ers’ DAVIID aims to meet thechallenges posed by this year's competitionrequirements and take lessons learned fromboth the positives and negatives of lastyear's design. 

The table below shows the Technical Performance Measurements of the robot.

## Mechanical System
As the integration Lead, I focused on creating Assembly, Machining, and Welding drawing. I also directed collaboration and integration between the Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering sub-teams. 

Below are examples of Assembly drawings I created in SolidWorks.
