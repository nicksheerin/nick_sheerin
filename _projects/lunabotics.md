This project was a collaborative effort between twenty-two students across four degree paths to compete in an autonomous mining competition sponsored by NASA's Artemis Program and Caterpillar.


As the Integration Lead, my focus was ensuring cohesive integration between the excavation, locomotion, electrical, and sensing systems. This position developed my skills leading a cross functional team and accounting for both the mechanical and power needs of the robot. As the Locomotion Lead, I focused on maximizing the weight to power ratio. These roles developed my skills using SolidWorks for large assemblies and part fabrication, Comsol for finite element analysis, and Matlab to account for buckling in the locomotion system.


## Overall Summary


The Apollo missions provided universities the ability to aid in the program by developing new technology for spacecraft and equipment and research material brought back from the lunar surface. NASA initiated the Artemis Mission in December 2017 to return astronauts to the Moon, to establish a long-term presence on the Moon and to gain experience in the inhospitable environment of space in preparation for the eventual journey to Mars. In 2010, the Lunabotics competition challenged Universities to develop a robot to autonomously mine the icy regolith beneath the Moon's surface. This icy regolith would then be processed to create water which doesn't require transport from Earth.


The competition requires the robot to move from a random orientation in the starting arena to the excavation zone. Once in the excavation zone the robot was required to dig 30.5 cm through crushed limestone to excavate regolith simulant (gravel).


New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology was the first team invited to the competition in 2021. I participated in both the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 competitions.

## System Overview


The robot, named DAVIID (Directed Autonomous Vehicle forInterspatial Digging, with II indicating its second generation), was designed to function on various terrain and perform the designated tasks as determined by the Lunabotics challenge criteria using NASA’s System Engineering process. Building on the insight gained by the development and performance of the previous robot, DAVID, Miner 49ers’ DAVIID aimed to meet the challenges posed by the 2023 competition requirements.


The table below shows the Technical Performance Measurements of the robot.

## Mechanical System
As the integration Lead, I focused on creating Assembly, Machining, and Welding drawing. I also directed collaboration and integration between the Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering sub-teams.


Below are some of the Assembly drawings I created in SolidWorks.
