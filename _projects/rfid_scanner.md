## Overall Summary

Lost baggage is a persistent cost to airline companies. In 2023 alone, airline companies mishandled 485.9 million bags[1]. 

## General Overview

 

## Control Diagram

The control of these devices is critical to the deployment of these devices in real-world situations. Typically, the control architecture can be categorized into 3 different tiers: high, mid, and low level controllers. 

The high-level controller is concerned with detecting user intent  â€” such as walking in different modes or estimating other environmental variables such as walking speed or ground slope angle (focus on my dissertation). This informs the mid-level controller which is responsible for generating the desired torque profiles. It uses an impedance control law that has tunable parameters coupled with a finite state machine (FSM) at each joint. We can break down the cyclic behavior of walking into 4 distinct phases, where each phase has adjustable parameters. Lastly, the low-level controller is responsible for matching the desired torque and actual torque outputted by our actuators. -->

## Results

<!-- Over the span of my Ph.D., I was fortunate enough to publish some findings that can be found [here](https://kbhakt.github.io/krishan_bhakta//publications/). Overall, by conducting multiple studies that looked at offline machine learning analysis of wearable sensors to validating the performance of these devices, I hoped to create a framework that would allow others to build upon this work. From my dissertation, the main research contributions included:

1) Developing the 1<sup>st</sup> user-independent (IND) real-time intent recognition system for both continuous and discrete estimation

2) Creating scalable control strategies across common ambulation modes and terrain grades

3) Performed biomechanical validations of powered prostheses compared to passive devices

The [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/t9WFBW-oOTE?feature=share) shows one of the first times, my team and I were able to implement a real-time intent recognition system for detecting locomotion mode changes embedded onto a Raspberry Pi that controlled the powered prosthesis.
